\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Since we have four members, we decided to tackle the project by assigning a deep learning model to each member. Saadiya implemented the Artificial Neural Network model and Anthony worked on the Multilayer Perceptron. Ritik created a Generative Adversarial Network and Kevin implemented a Convolutional Neural Network.
