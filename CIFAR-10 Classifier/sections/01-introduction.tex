\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Over the course of the term, we have implemented deep learning models on a very simple data set, the MNIST, which only focused on classifying binary images of digits. In order to expand on this learning, we wanted to see how well we could adapt our existing models to a new data set which is about classifying small color images which involves a higher dimensional approach to be able to train our model. For our research, we decided to design several deep learning architectures including ANN/MLPs, CNNs, and a GAN for the purpose of identifying the one that performed the best with our testing set. Along the way, we found some overfitting which turned out to be a very big issue with our learned models, so we came up with some regularization algorithms to be able to counter the overfitting we came across. This did not work so we decided to remove the dropout layer (the layer containing the regularization algorithm) from our ANN and MLP architectures.
